- on figure thumbnail, tick to represent in stock and cross to represet pre-order
- For Browse Page, seperate tabs between In-Stock and Pre-Order
- redo database:
    - Create new tables, keep old one as reference.
    - release_date should be a datetime so we can check if this is preorder or is release_date
    - the id should still be random generated. But we will be using JAN_Code as foreign keys.
    - Split price and figure into different tables.
        - price should store the name of the site it extracts from.
        - price should store the JPY price only.
        - figure table shoud store date added so we can sort by when the item was added into database.
